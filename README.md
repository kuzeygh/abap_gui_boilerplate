# Boilerplate for ABAP applications with HTML UI and abapmerge

Work in progress, don't use yet

## Main idea
A template/framework for HTML based GUI applications like in abapGit. Ideally based on abapGit classes. The code should be build-able with `abapmerge` into a working single file without dependencies.
